The goal of the training is the leadership development in general, and to be specific, it is especially important to prevent Attrition related to a high level European project, so it must be prioritized. Until now, we sent emails and follow up emails as reminders but only the %40 of the target audience was enrolled to the trainings. We need their managers to follow up and be more pushy about the subject. When they do not enroll their people or they enroll but their people still do not show up, we have less participation and less engagement during the sessions, not enough people to create breakout rooms for example, and this effects the program's performance and success negatively. I feel undervalued and less cared. They do not care at all about our trainings, they do not find it worth seeing, they do not even read the emails from our department. I feel ""nice to have"" instead of a ""need to have"" in this organization. Not only operations put effort in their business, but we as the support departments do the same. It is disappointing to see that our efforts are not seen and appreciated. Yes, I value recognition, collaboration and the professional development. When I do not see the comeback of what I have given and put effort on, I lose my motivation to continue doing the work and to strive for more. yes, all good so far My emails and reminders were not answered, they are left unresponded, and there is no progress on the number of the enrolled participants. My assumption is either they are busy or they do not see value in attending or enrolling their team members to these sessions. I feel comfortable with this distinction between facts and thoughts, nothing else to add, thank you. that's more than enough, thanks a lot! very satisfactory extremely helpful I like its objective approach clarifying the picture and show it to me from an outside perspective. tips and guidance were also helpful! thanks!","The goal of the training is the leadership development in general, and to be specific, it is especially important to prevent Attrition related to a high level European project, so it must be prioritized.

"Prepare for a difficult conversation I am going to have I plan to have a discussion with the client in which I'd like to explore the possibility of opening a brand new role in my current team. Context: as my team has been ramping down and the business has been moved to a different, more cost effective country, I will need to close a Leader position in order to meet the ratio of Leader:team members and not be over it. I currently have 1 Leader with strong knowledge in tools, who has been contributing in this space from his current role, because he enjoyed it.  the person I plan to have the conversation with is super focused on cutting costs and very number oriented. The current relationship is client - manager, we have a contract and certain KPIs. The person is quite new to this line of business and I haven't yet managed to build a trust based relationship. I am worried that I might be pushing for the wrong direction, as I am aware of the client strategy and this might have an impact on the overall operations/business - A manager who doesn't understand the goals and is pushing for something else. Another concern is the fact that with closing 1 position, talent will go away and we're losing people who can add value to both the client and us. The person is rarely taking into account the human aspect of the business and I dislike that as it goes against my values as leader. I am worried that if I am not gonna have the discussion, I have not done everything my powers to at least try and explore this possibility. On the other hand, If I will have the discussion and I will be perceived like I mentioned above, I might be deemed as not competent.  I feel like my direct manager is not supportive of this exploration and I could really use their help That is all for now I would also add something related to business continuity. I am aware of the business goals and targets and I don't shy away from making a difficult decision and implement it. The only thing I'd like to do first si explore all possible options. that is all The ratio is not within parameters. 1 Leader is now a surplus. One Leader has technical skills to handle tools and this has been demonstrated in the past, observed by both parties. There are no 1 on 1 meetings with the person representing the client. because I only see the person in large meetings, they might assume a needed role. In 1 to 1 conversations, things might be different.
The surplus leader skills might be underutilized as well, however the client would need to agree to the extra value the leader can bring in as it would result on an increased cost on their side all good! this helps! thank you! sure very satisfactory extremely helpful I really liked the structure and how the context has been summarized.  one last thing can you help me with an example of the conversation for the scenario above? looks good! how would you envision the proposal outlining the pilot? looks good.

"Prepare for a difficult conversation I am going to have Several team members are not following a critical process.  They want to skip the process and get their work assigned When an RFP comes in the CSE is supposed to review the document, provide a strategy and open a case.  After that they are supposed to schedule a call with me.  Instead, they simply schedule a call with me. without doing the background work required It happens whenever this specific team gets an RFP. It is not an issue for other teams.   They have not had leadership in a long time.  Their new leader does not know or like any standard processes. They feel empowered not to follow the process They don't care about the process. They think we should just ""jump"" on demand.  They do not realize how disruptive their actions are and they think they are above the process.  They are long time employees and they should have proactively learned the process by now.  They don't seem to care though no accountability and respect Their actions impact my ability to handle the work load of others This resonates with me A meeting has been called today with several stakeholders before the intake process has been completed.  I do not know what the opportunity is about and I don't think it will be a productive meeting I am anticipating they will want a quick response from me on an assignment of resources and I will not be able to assign the resource yes!  thoughts vs. facts! I would wait for the person who called the meeting to begin to talk I will wait to see if they have a strategy outlined and if they have identified the solution and time commitment.

"Review a difficult conversation I already had My team member asked for a promotion and salary increase and I would like to support, but I am not an ultimate decision maker. I am the team member´s manager and I have a senior role in the company, but there are more senior stakeholders that need to approve the decision and based on my recent experience there is a lot of constraints for  allowing promotions. They mentioned they have been in the company for a couple of years, delivered improvements and their responsibilities have changed, so they felt there is a time to make another step. I agreed that the ask was fair and that I will work on checking. However, I also felt I might not be able to make it happen and the team members would get upset and quit. It felt the team member was not satisfied with their current state, but they didn´t express it specifically. It might have been just my assumption. Indeed, the team member might have just expressed their thought that it is the right time for growth, but the next step could have been (or could still be) discussing facts, practices and objectives of the promotion process. Yes. We could discuss the usual career progression timeline in the context of this team member´s current role. Also, what options there are for career progression - like through delivering objectives in their current role versus looking for open roles within the team and the company. What is ultimately the team member´s goal - grow within my team, or generally progress their career. That would be useful. It seems like you would like to grow within the company: what are your concrete expectations in terms of the career growth? Thank you. You have indeed delivered a great service and been a pivotal part of the team. That is already part of your current role scope, but sets good grounds for next steps. What are your actual career priorities? Great, it seems you have been thinking about your career growth thoroughly, this is a great step towards success. What are the 3 areas you think you are strong and that would support your further career growth? And what are 3 areas of improvements that you think you might still need to work on? Thank you, it is great you are thinking about your skill areas and how to continuously improve. The next level role in our team you might be looking for does require strategic thinking and technical expertise, it would be great, if we could work together on expanding your knowledge in those areas to prepare you for the possible next step. Sounds good. We can work on recommending specific training modules in our training academy and I can also invite you to specific discussions, where you can practice these skills. Thanks for this fruitful discussion. I acknowledge your willingness and passion to grow within my team and the company and with this conversation, we can work together on getting you ready for possible next steps. We might not have an opportunity for immediate promotion, but the ideas discussed here can help you succeed, when such an opportunity appears. In the meantime, you can actively work on your skills and career growth and we will support you as applicable. I think this is a good approach, it helps to uncover specific details of the situation rather than getting stuck on assumptions.

"Prepare for a difficult conversation I am going to have I would like to have a conversation with my Manager with regard to allowing a teammate to work on a different shift. I know that soon those team members reporting to me will ask about it and I don't have the answers. Admittedly, I'm also questioning my manager's decision to allow a certain team member choose her shift schedule. I know that my manager has an acceptable reason but at the same time deep inside me, I deeply opposed this decision. I do not really know how to explain it to my team.  I'm relieved  that at this point there are no team members yet expressing opposing views to my manager's decision. I am just anxious if someone ask me about it and I don't have any valid reason to share that is aligned to my manager's answer. On my manager's decision, I feel that it is unfair but at the same time there must be an underlying rationale not shared to the team why this teammate was given this privilege to choose her shift. As for the potential questions from the team, it can be more of question around the mechanics to gain the same privilege to choose the preferred shift, also not really a question but more on an precedence that everyone now will think they can ask the management to change their work shift. I see it as an unfair privilege and do not see any value to the team's process. In fact, it seems like this teammate with a different shift cannot contribute well whenever there are critical projects during our standard shift. Also, it feels like the rest of the team is adjusting to her schedule. nothing more It is really more on the issues around transparency and fairness.  Nothing more. The teammate must have presented a valid case to our manager with regard to her request to have a different work shift schedule. My manager has always been fair and I think allowing my teammate to work on this schedule must have business value as it was approved by the boss of my managers nothing else I like to practice how I should start this conversation. Good morning, Giana! I hope you have time today to have a conversation with me. I have some concerns with regard to Ron's new shift schedule. You just shared during our team meeting two days ago about Ron's new work schedule, at the same time, every time we collaborate with Ron, you never missed reminding us about his new schedule. I am wondering how he got his new schedule and concerned that the team is adjusting to it. The major challenge is he won't be involved on those projects with critical deadline since half of the day, Ron is already out of the office Actually, I don't have any suggestions because the only thing I could suggest is to make it fair for everyone. I believe the need of the business is for everyone to work on the same schedule.  Yes, I agree that there are definitely ways for us not to get affected by this new schedule. We can definitely talk again tomorrow when I have some options to discuss I appreciate your time as well.

"Prepare for a difficult conversation I am going to have A feature design, which was not my oriGianal approach, but a compromise, is now again being re-assessed from zero. This has been really frustrating and I find myself in the position of trying to move forward, defending an idea not of my own, but avoiding further delays on implementation. The organization has appointed two principal engineers as approvers, on top of the software delivery manager, who were all involved in the compromise process and now are stepping back all over again on the whole feature. I have voiced over my concern and frustration with the excessive emphasis on detailed planning vs iterating over PoCs or preliminar deliveries, to actually see how the feature works. I have also voiced my concern with how the approach is keeping us very slow, not at all agile. Got it, yes, I have a general frustration on the overall approach the processes are being shaped. They are limiting my ability to tap into my creativity and knowledge for solving problems, as the experience is that it will not be put to use, and rigidity in planning will prevail anyways. Yes, I am concerned with what resembles entropy, but applied to processes. As progress goes by, less and less value adding activities and controls pile up. More roles for these controls and reworks needs to be added. The organization becomes bloated and slow. This is something I have encountered repeatedly as organizations I've been part of grow. In two or three years time things become bureaucratic, not agile. Since I believe adaptability is far more valuable than having every single possible control and process outlined, I experience a lot of dissonance in these situations.  Yes, the project has experienced an overall lack of control, the scaled tip to the opposite side too much, is my sense. There is a sweet balance between controls and innovation, it's tricky, I acknowledge that. Yes, this has been very productive. Thanks a lot. I'm good for now. Enough to ponder about for a while.

"Prepare for a difficult conversation I am going to have I'll be talking to the VP of IT regarding the concern of team members not getting promoted and yet they see a lot of external hires with higher pay. This is going on for quite some time already and although other leaders have been vocal about it, the VP of IT always challenges our inputs and in the end, things would go his way not because we're not able to defend our point that well but because he has a close mind on this. My relationship with the VP is on a professional level but I think he feels a lot more superior than me so he tends not to listen when aggitated. I am hoping that he would be more receptive to the idea by end of the conversation. Although I do not have much documented proof on the performance of the team members whom I want to promote, I do see that we still need to give them some level of progression given that they have been in the company for years already. Yes, I feel that we are not being fair to the team members. Me personally, I feel that my voice is not respected as I am not being heard despite the repeated conversations about this. I know that if we do not address this, that many of the tenured team members would end up resigning. Unfortunately I believe that the VP does not care whether we lose these team members. No that's it for now. The truth is that we are not valuing the importance of our team members as we are not prioritizing their career growth. This is the core of the issue. Yes, one fact is that we prefer external hires than recognizing the ones we already have. It's also a fact that we are not good in documenting our achievements properly that is why during performance reviews, we are not able to defend the scores we would like to give to our team members. I'm assuming that the VP is not able to see all the hard work that the team members are giving because they are not being communicated to him that well. I think I'm ready.

Do you want us to pull also HR into this conversation so we can gain their thoughts as well? Here's my response to scenario 1: No doubt that external hires can provide us with fresh perspectives.

THat is not the case when another job with similar benefits is being offered within another entity of the group company. the employer thinks that employees who want the severance take advantage of the situation. They just want the money and will then apply for a job with a competitor. Why should the employer pay for this if he himself can offer them jobs? THe employees think they deserve a severance payment for their past work for the company. from the legal perspective, severance is only being paid to cover the risk of unemployment due to an employers decision.
