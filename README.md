# AI Coaching Conversations Analysis

> **Note:** This project is intended as part of a test assignment for some company. Please consider the scope and purpose 
> of the project when reviewing.

This repository contains analysis of conversation data from an AI coaching platform. The project processes
raw conversation data, extracts both quantitative and qualitative metrics, and presents insights via an interactive 
Streamlit dashboard.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to extract actionable insights from a dataset of conversations generated by an AI coaching platform. Key features include:

- **Data Processing:** Parsing and cleaning raw conversation data, distinguishing JSONL from JSON array formats, and extracting key fields such as metadata, conversation turns, user feedback, and error information.
- **Defining Success:** Implementing heuristics (e.g., checking the last few messages for specific feedback keywords) to flag conversations as “successful.”
- **Metrics Calculation:** Computing dialogue lengths (word counts excluding system messages) and turn metrics (number of user vs. assistant turns and average turn length), with special handling for outliers.
- **Quantitative Analysis:** Presenting overall conversation metrics, such as total and successful conversation counts, and visualizing dialogue length distributions (with outliers excluded) and median lengths for individual dialogues.
- **Qualitative Analysis:** Exploring thematic insights from specific conversations (for example, conversation #3 with the highest average words per turn and conversation #17 with the lowest), with options to expand or hide detailed reports.
- **Conclusions**

For further insights and raw exploration of the data, please refer to the `conversations_research.ipynb` notebook. Though it is raw,
the notebook documents the initial experiments. Probably in the meantime it will be cleaned and re-uploaded.
